## Purpose

We want to create a system that will alert the user that they havent flipped a page in a while. 
Reminding them to read more and in a timly manner. This system will include a feather/very sensitive
switch to sense when a page is being turned. It will then reset a timer tjhat will, when ended, 
will sound a buzzer until the user reads more.

## Initial Design Plan

Outline:
- Parts: Arduino for the board, buzzer, Feather switch
- Parts of code:
  -Loop of timer
  -while statement that checks when the switch is flipped
  -initial setup
  

**Feather Book**:

![Initial Design of how its made](images/featherbook.PNG "Feather book design.")
